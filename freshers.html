							<p><strong>MSU Title: </strong>Mature Student Officer</p>
							<p class="bottom"><strong>About Me: </strong>This is my 3rd year at Marjon and having been a Student Rep for the last two years, I wanted to go that little bit further when it comes to representing my fellow students. As we make up such a large part of the student body, it's important that the Mature Students of Marjon have a voice. By working with the other Student Union officers, I hope to help make the experience of coming to study at Marjon, as rewarding and fun as possible.</p>
